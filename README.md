# About

A simple full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS) app for managing a pet store. It allows users to:
* Add pets,
* Edit pets, and,
* Delete pets

This project was based off the YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3BUHwfHf84). This project was created to learn MERN.
